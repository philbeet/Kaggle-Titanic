<h1>Kaggle Contest - Titanic</h1>
<h2>By Phil Rongo</h2>

This is my first Kaggle.com competition. In this independent project, I learned
a lot about feature engineering and model selection. I also used data visualization to help
wrap my head around data relationships. With this model, I achieved **76.6% accuracy**.

I would say the biggest part of this challenge was feature engineering, and I am especially proud of
the way that missing values for age were handled. Many thanks to scikit-learn devs for making such an intuitive and
uniformly built library.
